--(Prerequisite knowledge)
WHen making the product master using SQL, the smallest unit is shop_information(shopid),item_information(itemid)
in the product master. In other words, they must be Unique.

step1)

SELECT

CASE WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(shopid,itemid)) =COUNT(CONCAT(shopid,itemid)) THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS shop_id_item_id_checking

FROM product_master

step2)

②When The result is True
WITH
  base AS (
  SELECT
    CONCAT(shopid,itemid) AS key
  FROM
    product_master
  GROUP BY
    1
  HAVING
    COUNT(CONCAT(shopid,itemid)) >=2 )
SELECT
  *
FROM
  product_master
WHERE
  CONCAT(shopid,itemid) IN (SELECT key FROM base)

step3)

③If you want to delete duplicate data
patten1）If all duplicate data values are the same
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
   product_master AS (
  SELECT
    DISTINCT *
  FROM
    product_master)

patten2）Duplicate data with different values, e.g., item_name
Numbering by line
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
  product_master AS (
  SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS num
    ,*
  FROM
   product_master )

After confirming the num of duplicate deletion targets, delete the duplicate.
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
  product_master AS (
  SELECT

    *
    
  FROM
    product_master
  WHERE 
   num NOT IN (1,2,3) )
